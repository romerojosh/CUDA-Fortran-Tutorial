# CUDA-Fortran-Tutorial
This repository contains several examples of basic CUDA Fortran usage and features.

To compile these examples, an up-to-date installation of the PGI compiler is required. The [PGI Community Edition][https://www.pgroup.com/products/community.htm] is a freely available version of the
compiler that you can download and use. Additionally, to run GPU examples, an NVIDIA GPU is required.
